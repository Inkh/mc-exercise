Conflicts between Bob, Carol, Ted & Alice ensued when Carol didn’t pull down from master after Bob & Carol’s pull request was merged into it. What we’ve learned in how to prevent merge conflicts is to always alert the team about merged pull requests and have everyone pull down from master to have the most updated version of the repo. Afterwards, each member must check out their own feature branch and run `git merge master`. If conflicts are present, it will show up in our IDE’s. We must resolve the conflicts with the most updated version of the code and then create a pull request.
