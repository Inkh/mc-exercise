# A sentence from Bob & Carol
> It's almost the weekend I can't wait to sleep. I can't believe how Alice and Ted just stare at each other all day. Ugh, Alice always smells like cheese.

Bob and carol drink too much...feature 2.0

not creating another work branch because there is no more cheese. 

Alice's bag is full of cheese, but she never shares. She made the team weaker as a whole.  

I'm so mad at Bob right now! He drank allllllllll my whiskey and shoved his mouth full of Alice's cheese >: | - Carol

# Alice likes two buck chuck

> Ted ate all of Alice's cheese, but Alice ate all of Bob's banana chips.

### Hey, everyone

I'm trying to create a conflict!!!!!
